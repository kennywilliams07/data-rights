                  <h2>Just Some Basic Data Info</h2>
                    <p>A lot of people don't think their data is a risk to their privacy. When you type something into a search engine, it doesn't just go away;
                     it's collected and reciprocated into mined ads. Most people believe that your collected data goes to fueling a psychological change in society.
                     Research shows that a data mining company based out of England had been employed by a presidential campaign to collect the data of Facebook users,
                     regurgitate that data into personalized smear campaign ads against opponents to further win over voters.
                    </p>
                    <p>Essentially the way that it basically breaks down, is that data is collected from your phone using an app- such as Facebook- and sent to a data center
                      to be processed and mined, and then stored for further use. The company referenced above, Cambridge Analytica, for instance, bought data collected from 
                      FaceBook and used it to produce ads for the app (wonder why you've googled something and then seen it on Facebook or Instagram?). A professor in New York
                      actually filed a suit to retrieve his data from the company and instead of just releasing it to him, it went to court and the company ultimately ended up
                      doing a hard drive dump. The company is no longer in business due to multiple court cases involving the collection and processing of data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since Facebook was involved, that also led to the CEO and founder of the company, Mark Zuckerburg, being called into question by the US government.
                      Questions were asked in regard to Facebook's data collection, selling of data, and whom they have sold data to. The multiple suits and court hearings
                      have led to many people in the tech industry to call into question the people's data rights. Many movements have begun to fight for data rights, the
                      ability to withdraw from data collection, and the usage of one's data.

                  <h2>What Happens To Your Data?</h2>
                    <p>When you get on Facebook or Twitter, and see your friends posting which Marvel hero they align with or what this survey says their spirit animal is, you may
                      think "Hey, I'd like to know if I'm Iron Man or Captain America." But what you don't think of, is will your answers be sent somewhere other than returned back to
                      you as results? Leading up to the 2016 election, there began a large spike of targeted ads. People would notice that they would talk about something to a friend,
                      or Google something and then see an ad for that very same thing on social media. That was just one thing; another was in the form of personality surveys. These
                      personailty surveys were sent out by Cambridge Analytica (employeed by the Trump campaign).
                    </p>
                    <p>If you were to take such surveys, your data would be collected to see what kind of person you are, and gear specific ads to tilt your voting. This tactic has been
                      suspected to have been used in not just the 2016 election when the Trump campaign spent $1 million a day on social media marketing, but also the Brexit campaign,
                      South American presidential elections, the Ted Cruz campaign, and many more around the world. The freaky part is that these surveys didn't just pull your data, but also
                      the data of everyone on your friends list.
                    </p>
                    <p>With the 21st century being the technological boom that it is, and evolving so rapidly, there aren't any regulations or laws protecting a person's data. Sounds scary,
                      and it is. We don't even flinch when we download an app and just blindly accept the user agreements, allow access to camera or microphone, or use our locations. Is any of
                      this information here to scare you? No. This information is here to bring awareness to Data Rights, which should be inate human rights. You should have the option to opt out 
                      of any data collection, have access to that data, and even use that data. Without data rights, the world will never see a true democracy. Our internet will become nothing more
                      than a series of ads, fake news articles, and our bank accounts will be dry due to paying for ad-blockers and subscription-based VPNs.
